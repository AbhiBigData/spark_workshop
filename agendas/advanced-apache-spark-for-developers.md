# Advanced Apache Spark for Developers Workshop (5 days)

## What You Will Learn / Objectives

The goal of the **Advanced Apache Spark for Developers Workshop** is to build the deeper understanding of the internals of Apache Spark 2.x (i.e. Spark Core, Spark SQL, Spark Structured Streaming and Spark MLlib). The workshop will teach you how to do performance tuning of Apache Spark applications and the more advanced features of Apache Spark.

**NOTE** The workshop uses the latest and greatest [Apache Spark 2.2.0](http://spark.apache.org/releases/spark-release-2-2-0.html).

The workshop follows a very intense **learn-by-doing** approach in which the modules start with just enough knowledge to get you going and quickly move on to applying the concepts in practical exercises.

The workshop includes many practical sessions that should meet (and quite likely exceed) expectations of software developers with a significant experience in Apache Spark and a good knowledge of Scala, senior administrators, operators, devops, and senior support engineers.

**CAUTION**: The workshop is very hands-on and practical, i.e. not for faint-hearted. _Seriously!_ After just a couple of days your mind, eyes, and hands will all be trained to recognise the patterns how to set up and operate Spark infrastructure for your Big Data and Predictive Analytics projects.
