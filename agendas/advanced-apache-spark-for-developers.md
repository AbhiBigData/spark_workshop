# Advanced Apache Spark for Developers Workshop (5 days)

## What You Will Learn (aka Objectives)

The goal of the **Advanced Apache Spark for Developers Workshop** is to understand the internals of Apache Spark 2.x and the modules (Spark SQL, Spark Structured Streaming and Spark MLlib). The workshop will give you a deep understanding of performance tuning of Apache Spark applications and the advanced features of Apache Spark.

**NOTE** The workshop uses the latest and greatest **Apache Spark 2.2.0**.

The workshop uses an intense **learn-by-doing** approach in which the modules start with just enough knowledge to get you going and quickly move on to applying the concepts in assignments.

The workshop includes many practical sessions that should meet (and quite possibly exceed) expectations of software developers with a significant experience in Apache Spark and a good knowledge of Scala, senior administrators, operators, devops, and senior support engineers.

**CAUTION**: The workshop is very hands-on and practical, i.e. not for faint-hearted. _Seriously!_ After just a couple of days your mind, eyes, and hands will all be trained to recognise the patterns how to set up and operate Spark infrastructure in your Big Data and Predictive Analytics projects.

**CAUTION** I have already trained people who expressed their concern that there were too many exercises. _Your dear drill sergeant, Jacek._
